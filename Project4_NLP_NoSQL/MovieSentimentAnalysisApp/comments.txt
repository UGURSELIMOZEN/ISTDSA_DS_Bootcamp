
excellent film of the great director frank darabont  strong acting  moderately inventive 
story  but not exactly unpredictable  a pleasantly uplifting film  but don t expect a transformative 
experience  andy dufresne  tim robbins  is a gangly young banker when he enters maine s fortress like 
shawshank state prison in  accused of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover  though his protestations 
of innocence don t carry much weight  his shy manner and decency does  befriended by red  morgan freeman   
a veteran con who is the prison fixer  he soon draws a circle of other boyishly likable prisoners around him  
including william sadler as a sweet tempered thug and james whitmore as a cuddly old man who is the prison 
librarian  in a film that stands or falls on the central character s amiability  tim robbins is loose and effective  
though the real performance here is from morgan freeman  whose projected affection for his friend really determines
how we feel about him  darabont s direction is precise and assured  without being terribly imaginative


well  it has been said by many that this is the role madonna was born to play  although on the receiving end of 
much criticism at the time for trying to instill some feeling of empathy with eva the woman shines in what is essentially 
one long form music video  the entire  filming evita  story could be made into a movie itself  such a long and torturous 
process that it became  however once it became clear that parker s attempt was highly likely to get off the ground madonna 
wasted no time in going for the role   look at her video for the  take a bow  single   she s pure eva   and once in the role 
it was famously madonna who persuaded the argentine president to allow permission to film on the balcony of the casa rosada 
in buenos aries  something no one else had been able to arrange  deservedly gaining madonna a golden globe  controversially 
not even gaining her a nomination come oscar time  this is possibly one of the most spectacular cinematic adaptations of a 
stage musical it has ever been my privilege to see  a masterpiece

i have just finished watching this movie and i finished the book yesterday  so while i have the book fresh in my mind i shall 
say this  the other boleyn girl  movie  is the worst book movie adaptation i have ever seen  for one king henry viii does not 
rape anne boleyn  mary boleyn bears two children to king henry  catherine and henry  william stafford is not in the book until 
towards the end when he whisks mary away to rochford  where they have their own children  the country anne refers when she sends 
mary away should have been hever not rochford  and also anne is exiled twice and she goes to hever not france this movie was 
appalling on all counts and i would never watch it again having read the book and also many more on the boleyn family and the 
tudor court  never have i been so disappointed in a movie  although i will give scarlett johansson a     for her acting  other 
than that this movie is boloks


cheaper by the dozen   is very nice and entertaining movie to see  i liked the first movie more but this one was still good  
cheaper by the dozen   is about the baker s family vacation and mostly about tom and his rivalry jimmy murtaugh and there competition  
unlike the first cheaper by the dozen  this one was focused more on the rivalry of tom s and his enemy instead of mostly about the children  
tom is jealous and annoyed of jimmy because he has a better home  well behaved children  better furniture and a pretty wife  alyson stoner  
sarah baker  did a great job in this movie  she was one of the many children with a main plot  she stole the show   great job  hilary duff  
lorraine baker  and tom welling  charlie baker  also did great  the younger kids were kinda eh this was a pretty funny movie  it had its funny 
moments  id recommend his movie  its worth watching  seriously
