# Project 2: Price Prediction using Regression with Web Scraping
###### Weeks 2 and 3

## Backstory:

Using information we scrape from the web, build linear regression models from which we can learn about e-commerce , movies, sports, or categories.

### Data:

 * **acquisition**: web scraping
 * **storage**: flat files
 * **sources**: (as listed below or any other publicly available information)   
  - e-commerce : https://www.cimri.com/ 
  - movie: boxofficemojo.com, imdb.com   
  - sports: sports-reference.com
  

### Skills:

 * basics of the web (requests, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
 * web scraping
 * `numpy`  , `pandas` , `matplotlib` , `seaborn` and `requests`
 * `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`


### Analysis:

 * Linear regression is required, other regression methods are optional
 * Ridge regression , Lasso regression and Elasticnet regression

## Deliverable/communication:

 * organized project repository
 * slide presentation
 * visual and oral communication in presentations
 * write-up of process and results


### Design:

 * iterative design process
 * "MVP"s and building outward
 * [stand-ups/scrums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) (1 minute progress updates to the class)


## More information:

We'll learn about web scraping using two popular tools - BeautifulSoup and Selenium. You must know the very basics of HTML. We can also evolve the way we use Jupyter notebooks; during this project, we begin to use the notebook as a development scratchpad, where we test things out through interactive scripting, but then solidify our work in python modules with reusable functions and classes.

We'll practice using linear regression. We'll have a first taste of feature selection, this time based on our intuition and some trial and error, and we'll build and refine our models.

This project will give you the freedom to challenge yourself, no matter your skill level. Find your boundaries and push them a little further. We are very excited to see what you will learn and do for Project Luther!
